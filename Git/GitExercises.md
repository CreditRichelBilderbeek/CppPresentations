## Grading

You will be graded on three things:
 * The GitHub you create for your project
 * Your GitHub profile
 * A document titled 'The Grade I Deserve Is ...'

Deadline for both is at 18:00 on this day.

The GitHub you create for your project should demonstrate that you've explored the possibilities of GitHub.
Possibilities to explore are, for example:
 * Create a nice README.md with useful pictures
 * Put your TODO list at the Issues
 * Add a license
 * Add a .gitignore file
 * Issues that are closed
 * Multiple commits with meaningfull commit messages
 * A merge conflict that has been checked in, then fixed in a later commit
 * A complete deletion of the GitHub, that has been undone in the next commit
 * A Pull Request from someone else, that has been accepted
 * A Pull Request from someone else, that has been rejected

Also the GitHub profile should demonstrate that you've explored the possibilties of GitHub.
Possibilities are, for example:
 * A profile picture
 * Becoming a collaborator at another GitHub (e.g. `github.com/richelbilderbeek/HetRoversnest`) and add content
 * Issue posted at GitHubs you are not a collaborator of
 * A GitHub you have forked
 * A successfull Pull Request you have made to another GitHub (e.g. `github.com/richelbilderbeek/RichelbilderbeekNl`)
 * A Pull Request you've made to another GitHub, that has been rejected
 * Following people
 * Starring GitHub projects

The document titled 'The Grade I Deserve Is ...' should be a Markdown file on your GitHub. Your README.md should mention it, so it can be found easily.
The document should convince the reader which grade you deserve on today's exercise. The document should have few words and many
screenshots. It *should* not be a professional document. Show what you have done without beautifying the document.

Things that have low/none impact for your grade:
 * Biological relevance
 * Spelling errors
 * Slick looks
